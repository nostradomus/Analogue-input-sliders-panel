### Electronics

#### The PCB

#### Connection with a µ-controller board

### µ-Controller code

The demo/test software has been written in the free [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), or as [sourcecode](https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/). No specific (or non-standard) libraries are required for this project.

### Mechanical construction

The housing consists of two layers of lasercut and engraved plexi plates. I would suggest to use 3mm of thickness. When using another thickness, pay attention to adapt the length of screws and bolts.
