This folder contains all files required to laser-cut and engrave the plexi plates for the housing.

For the initial built, 3 mm plexi material has been used.  

When using another thickness, the length of the srews and bolts should be adapted.

The .cdr-files have been created with CorelDraw, and have been optimized for [Trotec laser and engraving machines](https://www.troteclaser.com/en/). The .svg-files contain the same drawings (created with [free InkScape](https://inkscape.org)), and might be better for processing in [open-hardware laser-cutting machines](https://onlfait.ch/fablab/services/machines/).

Three different RGB-colors have been used :

 - black : engraving
 - red : internal cut-outs
 - blue : outline cut

The compressed file [```digital-font.zip```](digital-font.zip) contains the .ttf font-files which have been used for the engraving. They might not be installed on your system. It concerns a free (for personal use) font which was downloaded from the internet somewhere in the 20th century, for which unfortunately the referring website does not exist anymore (http://digitalfont.hypermart.net).
